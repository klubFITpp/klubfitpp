As is tradition, this semester we’re once again hosting OpenStudySessions — a chance to get together, put our heads together, and leave a little smarter than we came. And even more traditionally, our very first OSS will be a Linux installation session, where experienced FIT students will help you choose (and install) a Linux distribution!

Whether you want to dual-boot, switch entirely to Linux, or just consult on what’s best for you, this event is exactly for you. On site we’ll have experts on all the options to help you pick the one that suits you best — even if that just means installing WSL.

There’ll also be some light refreshments at the event, so all the convincing about Arch Linux won’t leave you hungry.

The event will take place on Semptember 25th at 18:00 in room TH:A-1455.

We’re looking forward to seeing you there! 💙💛
