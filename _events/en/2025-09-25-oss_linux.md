As is tradition, this semester weâ€™re once again hosting OpenStudySessions â€” a chance to get together, put our heads together, and leave a little smarter than we came. And even more traditionally, our very first OSS will be a Linux installation session, where experienced FIT students will help you choose (and install) a Linux distribution!

Whether you want to dual-boot, switch entirely to Linux, or just consult on whatâ€™s best for you, this event is exactly for you. On site weâ€™ll have experts on all the options to help you pick the one that suits you best â€” even if that just means installing WSL.

Thereâ€™ll also be some light refreshments at the event, so all the convincing about Arch Linux wonâ€™t leave you hungry.

The event will take place on Semptember 25th at 18:00 in room TH:A-1455.

Weâ€™re looking forward to seeing you there! ðŸ’™ðŸ’›
