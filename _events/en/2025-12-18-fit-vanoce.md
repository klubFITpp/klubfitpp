Dear students and non-students, come and celebrate the magic of Christmas together and end this year and the winter semester with our traditional Christmas event. FIT Christmas will take place on December 18 from 12:00 p.m. in rooms TH:A-1455 and TH:A-1435. 🎄

You can look forward to a festive atmosphere, mulled wine, gingerbread decorating, a Christmas tree, board games, and Secret Santa. Come and enjoy a pleasant gathering with a Christmas spirit and good time with friends.

We look forward to seeing you there. 💛💙
