# Join us!

Are you studying at the Faculty of Information Technology and want to meet active FIT students or just find a way to relax after Progtest?

Then you've come to the right place!

We are FIT++, a students club which operates at the Faculty of Information Technology at CTU. We organize events such as [Hello FIT](/hellofit), FIT Party, board games at the faculty, FITrips, LAN parties, and many other educational and fun events, where you can not only gain knowledge beyond the scope of school subjects, but also meet many active people from the faculty.
