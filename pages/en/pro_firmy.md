# Collaboration with the FIT++ club at the Faculty of Information Technology

The FIT++ student club is an active community of students at the Faculty of Information Technology. Our main goal is to offer students a variety of beneficial activities beyond their studies that make student life at the faculty more enjoyable. We organize leisure events, sports activities, and game nights. Every year, dozens of volunteers participate in these activities, ensuring that all events run smoothly and are as beneficial as possible for students.

We also organize professional workshops and seminars that allow students to gain practical experience and learn about current technologies and trends in IT that are not part of the primary curriculum at the faculty. We are looking for innovative companies from the IT sector that are interested in establishing cooperation and supporting or participating in our educational and leisure initiatives.

### Opportunities for cooperation

#### Workshops or lectures at your company
We would like to visit your company and participate in a workshop on various IT topics that are the subject of your company's expertise. From experience, we have found that a lecture or workshop lasting up to one hour in the late afternoon works well. The usual attendance is 15-25 students. It is possible to arrange to rent a space at our faculty, but we prefer to use your company's premises. We like to end the meeting with networking or informal conversation.

#### Joint PR products
We are also open to collaboration on joint PR products. Following the example of other foreign faculty clubs, we know that a T-shirt with a technical joke is an ideal advertising space that will be seen by everyone on campus. If this is a collaboration that makes sense for your company, we are fully open to it.

#### Support for our events
We are a non-profit organization operating solely with the support of volunteers, and thanks to even small amounts of support, we are able to rapidly increase the quality and attractiveness of our events for our students. During the year, we organize several smaller events for dozens of students, once a year we organize an event for 300 new students, and a party with student bands for about 150 people. We offer companies the opportunity to promote themselves through these events.

If you are interested in cooperation or would like to know more, please do not hesitate to contact us at [fitpp@su.cvut.cz](mailto:fitpp@su.cvut.cz). We look forward to working together on projects that will benefit both students and your company.
